# Blind - A theme pack for AwesomeWM
===================================

This theme pack host some of my experimental and day to day themes.

For now, all of them are based on the "arrow" theme I have been working
on for the past 6 years or so. Later, some more base-theme may be added.
The themes themselves look just like your everyday awesome theme, an array
with a bunch of colors and patterns settings. All the big lifting is done
under the hood by some helper files. You don't have to work with them, 
they are totally hidden from the user point of view.

## Arrow
### SciFi
A dark theme with light text, blue glow and 45 degree patterns.
